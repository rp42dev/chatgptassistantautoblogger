## What makes a brand an Old Money Brand
-------------------------------------

Generally speaking an old money brand is defined by the billionaires of the world. There are a lot of London based Saville Row tailors who are considered to be old money brands, but if we're talking about [Italian luxury brands](/ "Italian Luxury Brands"), the main two are the Neapolitan tailoring houses of Cesare Attolini and Kiton.

Kiton and Cesare Attolini are two of the most famous brands within billionaire CEO communities, and even by presidents and leaders of the world. 

If you're wondering what suit brand your boss is wearing, then it's most likely either an Italian suit from one of those two brands, or it's something similar. 

## How should a millionaire dress up?

You are probably expecting to be told to wear an entire three-piece suit, a flat cap, a tie, some bracers, and more. However, you may or may not be surprised to know that despite the tradition of dressing up smartly - Rich people have recently been becoming more casual.

Especially after the pandemic, more and more millionaires (and even billionaires) have been wearing more casual items. For flying for example, you will be hard-pressed to find something more comfortable than a designer [Italian sweatsuit](/collections/tracksuits "Italian Sweatsuits").

## What is the Old Money Aesthetic?
--------------------------------

The Old Money aesthetic is all about understated elegance. It is the antithesis of trends and fads, instead favouring timeless classics that are built to last. Quality is key, both in terms of materials and craftsmanship. Old Money interiors are usually warm and inviting, with a focus on comfort and relaxation.

Furniture is often upholstered in rich fabrics like velvet or leather, and floors are covered in thick carpets or polished wood. Curtains are heavy and luxurious, while walls are either painted in neutral colours or covered in classic wallpaper patterns. The overall effect is one of effortless sophistication â€“ the kind of elegance that only comes with time and money.

Clothing is the same - trends are replaced by timeless excellence, such as the brands mentioned in this article.

  

## Where did the Old Money Aesthetic come from?
--------------------------------------------

In today's society, there is a growing trend of people aspire to have an "old money" aesthetic. But where did this aesthetic come from? Old money is typically associated with wealth and prestige. The term is often used to describe people who were born into wealth or have inherited it. This type of money is different from "new money," which refers to people who have acquired wealth through their own hard work and ingenuity.

The old money aesthetic can be traced back to the Gilded Age, when a small number of families controlled a large percentage of the country's wealth. These families were known for their lavish lifestyles and extravagant homes. They also tended to marry within their own social class, which helped to solidify their position in society.

While the old money aesthetic may have its roots in this era, it has since been popularized by Hollywood and the fashion industry. In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in this aesthetic, as more people aspire to have the lifestyle of the rich and famous. This has been boosted by TikTok.

What are the main characteristics of Old Money Aesthetic?
---------------------------------------------------------

To understand the Old Money Aesthetic, here's a list of the key characteristics:

*   Old money style is typified by bright colors like white, light blue, or rose.
*   High-quality fabrics like linen, cotton, Cashmere, silk, wool are used.
*   Sweaters are very frequently used
*   Sporty clothes which wouldn't look out of place at a golf tournament are often used
*   Designer logos are avoided - stealth wealth is king
*   Hats, silk scarves, and gloves are elegant accessories that are often used.
